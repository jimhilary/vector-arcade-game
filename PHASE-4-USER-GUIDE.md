## 🎯 SCORING SYSTEM (How to Get Points)

### Asteroid Values

| Size | When You Destroy It | What It Does | Points |
|------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **LARGE** 🔷 | Splits into 2 Medium | **20 pts** |
| **MEDIUM** 🔶 | Splits into 2 Small | **50 pts** |
| **SMALL** ⬢ | Destroyed completely | **100 pts** |

### Score Milestones

```
   0 ──────► LEVEL 1 (4 asteroids)
             Easy! Get comfortable
             
 500 ──────► LEVEL 2 (5 asteroids)
             🎉 LEVEL UP!
             
1000 ──────► LEVEL 3 (6 asteroids)
             🎉 Getting harder!
             
1500 ──────► LEVEL 4 (7 asteroids)
             🎉 Pro territory!
             
2000+ ─────► LEVEL 5+ (8+ asteroids)
             🎉 Master level!
```

**TIP:** Each 500 points = New level = More asteroids = Harder (but more fun!)

## 🎮 CONTROLS (What Each Key Does)

### Keyboard Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     W        ↑               │
│   Thrust   Thrust            │
│                              │
│  A     D   ←    →           │
│ Left  Right Left Right       │
│                              │
│      SPACE                   │
│    Fire Bullets              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Each Key Does

**THRUST (W or ↑):**
- Push forward in the direction you're facing
- Hold to keep accelerating
- Release to drift (inertia!)

**ROTATE LEFT (A or ←):**
- Spin your ship counter-clockwise
- Hold for continuous rotation
- Quick taps for precise aiming

**ROTATE RIGHT (D or →):**
- Spin your ship clockwise
- Hold for continuous rotation
- Quick taps for precise aiming

**FIRE (SPACE):**
- Shoot bullets in direction you're facing
- Can shoot multiple at once
- Bullets destroy asteroids

**TIP:** You can hold W + A or W + D to thrust while turning!

---

## 💡 GAMEPLAY TIPS (How to Win)

### For Beginners

1. **Learn to Fly First**
   - Practice moving without shooting
   - Get comfortable with rotation
   - Learn how inertia works (you keep moving!)

2. **Destroy Big Ones First**
   - Large asteroids are easier to hit
   - But they split into 2 medium ones
   - Plan your shots!

3. **Use Screen Wrapping**
   - Go off the right = appear on left
   - Go off top = appear on bottom
   - Use this to escape!

4. **Don't Stay Still**
   - Always keep moving
   - Asteroids will hit you!
   - Thrust, rotate, repeat

### For Advanced Players

1. **Chain Destruction**
   - Split large → 2 medium (20 pts)
   - Split medium → 2 small (50 pts each = 100 pts)
   - Destroy small (100 pts each = 200 pts)
   - **Total: 420 points from one large asteroid!**

2. **Control the Center**
   - Stay near screen center
   - More room to escape
   - See all asteroids at once

3. **Shoot Ahead**
   - Asteroids move fast
   - Aim where they're going
   - Not where they are!

4. **Save Your Lives**
   - You get 3 lives
   - After hit = 2 seconds invulnerable (flickering)
   - Use this time to reposition!

## 🏆 LEADERBOARD STRATEGY (How to Rank High)

### Getting on the Board

**Minimum Scores to Beat (typically):**
```
#10:  2,000 pts  (Level 4 minimum)
#5:   3,500 pts  (Level 7 minimum)
#1:   5,000+ pts (Level 10+ required!)
```

### Score Optimization

**Bad Strategy:**
```
Shoot randomly → Hit some → 2,000 pts → #10
```

**Good Strategy:**
```
Target large asteroids first
Split them all
Then clean up mediums
Finally destroy smalls
Result: 3,500+ pts → Top 5!
```

**Pro Strategy:**
```
Clear levels methodically
Maximize split chains
Survive to Level 10+
Result: 5,000+ pts → #1! 🥇
```

---

## 📅 LEADERBOARD FILTERS (When to Check Each)

### All Time
**Shows:** Every score ever submitted
**Best for:** Overall ranking, seeing legends
**Example:** "Who's the best player EVER?"

### Today
**Shows:** Scores from today only (resets at midnight)
**Best for:** Daily competition, fresh starts
**Example:** "Can I be #1 TODAY?"

### This Week
**Shows:** Scores from last 7 days
**Best for:** Weekly challenges, recent performance
**Example:** "Am I the best this WEEK?"

**TIP:** Aim for #1 in "Today" first - it's easier than "All Time"!

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING (If Something Doesn't Work)

### "I Don't See the Welcome Screen!"

**Check:**
1. Did the page load completely?
2. Try refreshing (F5)
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### "Leaderboard Shows 'Loading...' Forever"

**Fix:**
1. Make sure plugin is **activated**:
   - Go to `http://wp-vector-game.test/wp-admin/plugins.php`
   - Find "Vector Game API"
   - Click "Activate"

2. Check database table exists:
   - Go to phpMyAdmin
   - Look for `wp_vector_game_scores` table
   - If missing, deactivate & reactivate plugin

### "My Score Didn't Save!"

**Check:**
1. Did you enter a name?

   ```

### "Level-Up Message Doesn't Show"

**Try:**
1. Make sure you reached 500+ points
2. Check if modal is hidden behind canvas
3. Refresh page and try again

### "Game is Too Fast/Slow"
